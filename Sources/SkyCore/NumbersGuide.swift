        GuideEntry(id: "rule", title: "Go rule and clear window",
                   body: "The clear window is an unbroken run of clear sky in astronomical darkness, long enough to take and stack many images of a target. You can change the rule in Settings › Go rule. By default the run lasts at least 3 hours, with cloud at or under 25%, and targets count when they are at least 30° up. Thin high cloud counts for half, since stacking works through it; low and middle cloud count in full. Clear sky by hour shows each hour’s cloud, judged the same way: a full bar is clear."),

                   body: "Astronomical darkness: the Sun more than 18° below the horizon, when the sky is as dark as it gets. In a British midsummer there is none, which is what Bright nights in Settings is for."),
        GuideEntry(id: "moon", title: "Moon",
                   body: "How much of it is lit, and when it is up during darkness. A bright Moon near a faint target washes it out: those are marked Moon-washed. The Targets window gives the next run of moonless nights."),

                   body: "How steady the air is, in arcseconds (″), from 7Timer. Smaller is sharper: about 1″ is excellent, above 2.5″ blurs fine detail. It matters most for planets and small galaxies."),

                   body: "How clear the air is to faint light: haze, dust and thin high cloud dim nebulae and galaxies even when the sky looks clear. From 7Timer."),

                   body: "Wind above 10 km/h starts to cost points, the most it can cost by 40 km/h, since a small telescope shakes in it. Dew risk is how close the air comes to its dew point: within 2 °C is High (fit the dew heater), within 4 °C Medium."),

                   body: "Shown on a night with a clear window when the air through it is forecast to carry enough smoke, dust or pollution to dim faint targets: an aerosol optical depth of \(Planner.hazeDepth) or more, from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service through Open-Meteo. At that depth about a third of a nebula’s or galaxy’s light is lost overhead, and over half at 30° up. The Moon, planets and bright clusters still work. The sky score does not count it."),

It is for a telescope left running after the window closes, so you know when to bring it in. A night that stays dry shows nothing."),

Mosaic: bigger than your field; shoot it in panels or choose part of it. Moon-washed and Near Moon: the Moon will dim it tonight. Naked eye and Binoculars: how it can be seen without a telescope."),
